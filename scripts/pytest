## This statement changes the behavior of the import statement
from plearn.utilities.versionning import *

## Since the main file of the project is the one importing versionning, the
## builtin import statement was in effect when it was loaded. Therefore, it
## must declare itself as a module after the project declaration
project = declare_project("PyTest")
project.declare_module(__name__, __cvs_id__)
project.neglect_module( "plearn.utilities.cvs" )
## project.neglect_module( "plearn.utilities.global_variables" )

### When an official build will be ready...
## official_build( "PyTest",
##                 build_version = [1, 0],
##                 fixlevels     = [5, 28, 89]
##                 )

## Shorthand
def pytest_version(extended=False): 
    return project_version("PyTest", extended)

import plearn.pytest
plearn.pytest.main( pytest_version )
