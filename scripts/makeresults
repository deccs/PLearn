# This script will make a .vmat and .amat to visualize and store the results of PLearn experiments.
# *** It needs 'plearn' to be compiled and in the path ***
# Typical usage is to put in the final_commands option of a PTester:
#   makeresults results_mat ${expdir}/global_stats.pmat param_1 ... param_n
#
# Arguments:
#   <matrix_name>  : the name of the output matrices, without the extension
#   <template_mat> : a matrix file readable by 'plearn vmat fields', whose fields names
#                    will be copied into the .amat field names
#   <parameter_i>  : the name of the i-th parameter to be reported in the results
#   <performance_i> : the name of the i-th statistics to be reported in the results
#
# Output: two files (.vmat and .amat), used respectively to visualize and store the results of
#         the experiments (using the appendresults script)
