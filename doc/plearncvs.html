<h1>
Five minute guide to using cvs with PLearn</h1>

<h3>
1. Initial setup</h3>
If you have been given a <i>username</i> and a <i>password</i> to access
the PLearn CVS repository, first login into the server:
<br><tt>% cvs -d :ext:</tt><i>username</i><tt>@cvs.plearn.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/plearn
login</tt>
<br>Enter your <i>password </i>when prompted.
<br>Then <tt>cd</tt> to the directory where your local copy of the PLearn
directory is to be created and issue the following command:
<br><tt>% cvs -d :ext:</tt><i>username</i><tt>@cvs.plearn.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/plearn
checkout PLearn</tt>
<br>Finally to clean up empty directories, you can do:
<br><tt>% cd PLearn</tt>
<br><tt>% cvs update -d -P</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
2. General cvs usage policy for the PLearn project</h3>
Sharing a code base with others requires a little discipline on the part
of everybody for things go smoothly.
<br>Here's our policiy, in short don't bother to much about the log messages
but:
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
commit very often</li>

<li>
update even more often</li>

<li>
commit all source files (<tt>*.cc</tt>, <tt>*.h</tt>) and <tt>Makefiles</tt>
(don't be afraid to use <tt>cvs add</tt> !!), but NO binary files (in general
don't do <tt>cvs add *</tt> !!).</li>

<li>
don't commit code that doesn't compile (but commit it as soon as it does
compile!)</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>This <i>``commit often, update more often''</i> policy will ensure that
the repository and your local copy keep in sync, this way merging conflicts
are rare, and the few that occur are easy to solve.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
3. Command summary for everyday use</h3>
Here is a summary of the few commands used for the every day operations
with the PLearn CVS.
<br>Whenever I write <tt>cd PLearn</tt>, I mean <i>``go inside your local
working copy of the PLearn directory that you checked out with cvs''</i>,
wherever that might be.

<tr>
<td><i><u>OPERATION</u></i></td>

<td><i><u>COMMANDS</u></i></td>

<td><i><u>REMARKS</u></i></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Updating your local copy</b></td>

<td><b><tt>% cd PLearn</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>% cvs update -d -P</tt></b><b><tt></tt></b>
<p><tt>Be CAREFUL to use <font color="#FF0000">LOWERCASE -d</font> and
<font color="#FF0000">UPPERCASE -P</font> (or you'll run into trouble!)</tt></td>

<td>If cvs reported any conflict while merging other's changes into files
that you also changed (files marked in the cvs output with a ``C''), you'll
have to edit the files by hand to resolve them.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Commiting your changes</b></td>

<td>First update your local copy:
<br><b><tt>% cd PLearn</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>% cvs update -d -P</tt></b>
<p>Resolve any conflict, make sure that you have issued a
<br><tt>cvs add</tt> for every new directory and source file you have added
(see below), check that everything compiles, and then do:
<br><b><tt>% cd PLearn</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>% cvs commit</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>&nbsp;</tt></b></td>

<td>If there's no problem, you'll be asked to enter a log message with
your favorite text editor (<tt>$EDITOR</tt>)
<p>cvs won't let you commit anything if your copy is not up to date or
if there are files with unresolved conflicts from the last update.
<br>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Creating a new sub-directory</b></td>

<td>Whenever you create a new directory in the hierarchy under cvs control
do the following:
<br><b><tt>% mkdir my_new_directory</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>% cvs add my_new_directory</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>% cd my_new_directory</tt></b></td>

<td>Note: the directory in which you create this sub-directory must already
be under cvs.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Adding files</b></td>

<td>To add a bunch of files that you have just created do&nbsp;
<br>(for example)
<p><b><tt>% cvs add *.cc *.h Makefile</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>% cvs commit</tt></b></td>

<td>Note: the directory in which you create these files must already have
been added by a cvs add command.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Removing files</b></td>

<td><b><tt>% cvs remove -f file1 file2 file3</tt></b>
<br><b><tt>% cvs commit</tt></b></td>

<td>All <tt>cvs add</tt> and <tt>cvs remove</tt> commands only <i>schedule</i>
the additions or removals.&nbsp; These will be taken into account in the
cvs repository only after you do a <tt>cvs commit</tt>.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Removing a directory</b></td>

<td>To remove a directory:
<li>
remove all files in it using <tt>cvs remove -f</tt></li>

<li>
then do a <tt>rm -r </tt>of the directory.</li>
</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Moving or renaming files or directories</b></td>

<td><b>Don't use the mv command !!!</b>
<br>If you really have to rename or move files or directories around, use
<tt>cp</tt>
to copy them to the new location (or new name), and use <tt>cvs remove</tt>
to remove the old version and <tt>cvs add</tt> to add the new one.</td>

<td>You may however use mv to move your local copy of the PLearn directory,
just not the subdirectories inside it.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Checking who committed modifications and what they were...</b></td>

<td>To check who and when commits were made and get corresponding revision
numbers:
<br><b><tt><font size=-1>% cvs log &lt;file></font></tt></b>
<br>To see what has changed between two different revisions:
<br><b><tt><font size=-1>% cvs diff -r &lt;first rev#> -r &lt;second rev#>
&lt;file></font></tt></b></td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Unremoving a file,&nbsp;</b>
<br><b>or (generally) reverting to an older revision</b></td>

<td>
<li>
Do a <b>cvs log &lt;file> </b>and get the latest revision number (that's
the "dead" revision if you're unremoving), and the older revision number
to which you want to revert (for ex. the next to last revision).</li>

<li>
Do <b>cvs update -j &lt;latest rev#> -j &lt;older rev#> &lt;file></b></li>

<li>
edit as you like if you wish and commit the file</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<p>Another (slightly more dirty) way to unremove a file is to checkout
the older revision without the sticky tag and readd the file
<li>
<b><tt><font size=-1>cvs update -p -r &lt;older rev#> &lt;file> > &lt;file></font></tt></b></li>

<li>
<b><tt><font size=-1>cvs add &lt;file></font></tt></b>&nbsp;</li>
</td>

<td>...</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Checking out an older version (revision) of a file</b></td>

<td>To check it out <i>without</i> setting the sticky tag:
<br><b><tt><font size=-1>% cvs update -p -r &lt;rev #> &lt;file> > &lt;newfilename></font></tt></b>
<p>To check it out and set the sticky tag:
<br><b><tt>% cvs update -r &lt;rev #> &lt;file></tt></b>
<br>You'll then want to get rid of the sticky tag at some point...
<br>&nbsp;</td>

<td>When you retrieve an older version of a file (with <tt><font size=-1>cvs
update -r </font></tt>or <tt><font size=-1>-D</font></tt>), cvs normally
associates a <i>sticky tag </i>to it, so that subsequent updates won't
overwrite it with the latest version of that file (your old version will
"stick" around!).</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Getting rid of sticky tags&nbsp;</b>
<br>(it also retrieves the latest version in the repository!!!)</td>

<td><b><tt>% cvs update -A &lt;file></tt></b></td>

<td>When you retrieve an older version of a file (with <tt><font size=-1>cvs
update -r </font></tt>or <tt><font size=-1>-D</font></tt>), cvs associates
a <i>sticky tag </i>to it, so that subsequent updates won't overwrite it
with the latest version of that file (your old version will "stick" around!).&nbsp;
<br>If you <i>do</i> want to overwrite it with the latest version and get
rid of the <i>sticky tag</i> do as instructed here.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>Adding binary files</b></td>

<td>
<li>
To add a binary file use <b><tt>cvs add -kb &lt;file></tt></b></li>

<li>
If you <i>forgot</i> the <b>-kb</b> when adding the file (and you've comitted
it), you can do the following to set the binary flag: <b>cvs admin -kb
&lt;file>;&nbsp; cvs update -A &lt;file>; cvs commit -m "made it binary"
&lt;file></b></li>
</td>

<td>&nbsp;If you forgot the -kb when adding the file on a non-unix system,
you'll have to copy a good copy of the file from outside CVS after the
<b>update
-A </b>and before the <b>commit.</b></td>
</tr>
