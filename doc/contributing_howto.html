<h2> Keeping up-to-date </h2>

<p>
The latest code can always be checked out through anonymous (pserver) CVS
with the following instructions. When prompted for a password for
anonymous, simply press the Enter key.
</p>

<tt>cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/plearn login</tt> 
<br/>
<tt>cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/plearn co PLearn</tt>

<p>
Then, to keep up-to-date with the code, you just have to regularly run
<tt>cvs update -d -P</tt> from <i>within</i> your checked-out PLearn directory.
</p>

<p>
I insist that this is only if you want to keep up with the rapid life-cycle of
the library, in which case you should also subscribe to the developers mailing-list. 
If you want <b>stability</b>, stick with the official tarball releases.
</p>

<h2> Occasional contributions </h2>

<p>
If you have found a bug, or fixed one, or written a piece of code that you
think might be worth including in the PLearn library, just send me an email
about it at <a href="mailto:vincentp@iro.umontreal.ca"> vincentp@iro.umontreal.ca </a>
</p>

<h2> Setting up CVS with write access </h2>

<p>
If you are to become a regular contributor, trusted with direct write
permission to the CVS repository, you must check out PLearn in a different
way.
</p>

Follow the steps described below:

<ol>

<li>If you don't already have one, open an account on sourceforge.net: go
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/account/register.php">there</a>, and try
your luck for a <i>username</i> that's not already taken and that you're
happy with...</li>

<li>Send me an email with your Source Forge <i>username</i> so that I can
add you to the list of PLearn developers.</li>

<li>If you don't already have a <tt>~/.ssh/identity.pub</tt> file on your
computer, generate one by typing the command <tt>ssh-keygen</tt> (or
<tt>ssh-keygen -t rsa</tt>). If prompted for a passphrase, simply type
enter (no passphrase) that's what I use and it's probably what you
want. The aim of the whole procedure is precisely to avoid having to retype
passwords every time you operate with CVS... And it's very safe as long as
people can't read your private <tt>~/.ssh/identity</tt> file (if they
can... well they've already hacked your account!). </li>

<li>Once you have been added to the list of PLearn developers, log in to the sourceforge web (click on <b>my sf.net</b> in the
tab-bar on sourceforge.net), go to your <b>account options</b> and click
on <b>[Edit Keys]</b> at the bottom of the page where it says <i>CVS/SSH Shared Authorized Keys</i>.
There, paste the <i>content</i> of your <tt>~/.ssh/identity.pub</tt> file and click 
on <b>Update</b> </li>

<li>Make sure that the environment variable <tt>CVS_RSH</tt> is
<i>always</i> set to <tt>ssh</tt> (add <tt>export CVS_RSH=ssh</tt> to your .shrc or .bashrc file, and 
<tt>setenv CVS_RSH ssh</tt> to your .cshrc or .tcshrc and launch a new shell)</li>

<li>I'll send you an email when I've added you to the list of
developers. Once you receive it, you can check-out PLearn (after making
sure there is no other PLearn directory in the way; rename it in PLearn.old
if necessary). Simply issue the following command: <br/>
<tt>cvs -z3 -d:ext:</tt><i>your_sourceforge_username</i><tt>@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/plearn co PLearn</tt>
</li>

</ol>
