\chapter{PLearn scripts}

\section{upackage}

{\bf upackage} is a python script (together with a set of python modules)
that can be used to easily install libraries and other tools on your
system.  It was created in order to simplify the installation of external
components on which PLearn depends, but it is a general packaging system
(usage is similar to {\em apt-get} or {\em emerge}) that may be used to install
about anything.

The {\bf u} in {\bf upackage} stands for {\bf u}ser, as you don'y need to
  be root to install stuff with {\bf upackage}.

Other typical packaging systems work under a number of assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item The person installing the package must have administrative rights
\item Dependency checking is done by requiring other packages \emph{of
  the same packaging system} to be installed (usually relying on a
  local database listing previously installed packages).
\item They are restricted to a single operating-system, even worse: to a specific
  distribution of that operating system. 
\end{itemize}

If you are a user then there are two possibilities. Either you are in the
ideal situation where somebody has written a package for your {\em
specific} os and distribution, and you are a very good friend of an {\em
efficient and dedicated} system administrator (not the overworked kind that
will "look into the matter when I have time"). Or you are not in
that ideal situation. Then you can always install by yourself from
source\ldots And you know how the music goes: search the web for some
install doc, find where to download the archive from, unpack, try to
compile, understand what is going wrong, patch some files, find out missing
dependencies and start over again for each of those: recurse!

We don't want people willing to try out plearn to have such a huge barrier to
entry. Hence {\bf upackage} is essentially an attempt to automate what
you'd do if installing all the dependencies by hand.

In other words: {\bf upackage} aims at becoming an automated non-root
cross-distribution and even cross-platform package installation system.
