// Object-friendly interface to the POSIX semaphore utilities.
// Here we have defined two types of semaphores: ResourceSemaphore
// and CountEventsSemaphore. In both cases multiple semaphores
// of the same type can be managed by the same object.
//
// A ResourceSemaphore allows to control exclusive access to
// some resources (each controlled independently of the others),
// using the lock/unlock methods. When a process tries to
// take the lock while another has it, it will wait until
// the controlling process releases the lock.
//
// A CountEventsSemaphore allows to count the number of occurences
// of one or more events. Some processes can signal the occurence
// of an event of a given type, without waiting. Other processes
// may wait for the count for an event type to reach a certain
// value (and then this value is reset to 0).
