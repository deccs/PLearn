//!   - its dimensions (length and width) are increased by 1

// In this function we update L so as to incorporate a new basis, i.e. n_active is incremented,
// using a new basis whose outputs on all the examples up to 'now' are given in new_basis_outputs.
// The dimensions of L are changed as a result. Note that L must have been pre-allocated
// with dimensions max_n_active x max_n_active. The matrix active_bases_outputs (n_active x n_examples)
// contains the outputs of the active bases that are in phi up to now.
