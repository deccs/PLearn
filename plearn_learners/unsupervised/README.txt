This directory contains learners designed mostly for unsupervised learning.

This includes:

* Standard preprocessings
  - Normalizer   ( substract  mean, divide by standard deviation)
  - Decorrelator ( substract mean, multiply by covariance matrix power -0.5 )

* Dimensionality reduction techniques:
  - PrincipalComponentAnalyser
  - KernelPCA
  - LLE
  - IsoMap

* Clustering techniques
  - KMeansClustering
  - SpectralClustering
