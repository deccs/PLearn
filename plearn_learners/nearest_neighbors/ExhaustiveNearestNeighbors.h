/**
 * This class provides the basic implementation of the classical O(N^2)
 * nearest-neighbors algorithm.  For each test point, it performs an
 * exhaustive search in the training set to find the K (specified by the
 * inherited 'num_neighbors' option) closest examples according to a
 * user-specified Kernel.
 *
 * It is important to specify whether the Kernel denotes a SIMILARITY or a
 * (pseudo-)DISTANCE measure.  A similarity measure is HIGHER for points
 * that are closer.  The GaussianKernel is a similarity measure.  On the
 * other hand, a distance measure is LOWER for points that are closer.  A
 * DistanceKernel is a distance measure.  The option
 * 'kernel_is_pseudo_distance' controls this:
 *
 *    - if false: the kernel is a similarity measure
 *    - if true (the default): the kernel is a distance measure
 *
 * The output costs are simply the kernel values for each found training
 * point.  The costs are named 'ker0', 'ker1', ..., 'kerK-1'.
 *
 * The training set is SAVED with this learner, under the option name
 * 'training_mat'. Otherwise, one would NOT be able to reload the learner
 * and carry out test operations!
