Here are the datasets in this directory:

eslt_mixture: [2-class classification] Mixture Simulation example from the
  book "Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman.
  Available at: http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/data.html
  under "Mixture Simulation".  File 'data_train.amat' contains 200 training
  examples, one for each class.  File 'data_test.amat' contains the "true"
  class for a lattice of points.  Note that the marginal probability of
  each lattice point IS NOT included in this test data, and hence this test
  file cannot be used to evaluate how close to the Bayes Error the
  classifier lies.
