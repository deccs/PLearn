# Dummy multi-class classification problem derived from the 'linear_4x_2y' dataset.
# The target is one of:
#   0 if y2 < -20
#   1 if -20 <= y2 < 20
#   2 if y2 >= 20
# The first five columns (x1 -> x4 and y1) are the inputs.
# These five inputs are processed through a sigmoid to ensure they are
# between 0 and 1.
